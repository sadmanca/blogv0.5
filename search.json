In the last post I pretty much exhausted my ability to look at the Star Wars data set that comes bundled in with the dplyr R package, so I’m picked something different this time. For no particular reason I decided to go with the Palmer Penguins data set that also exists in R, and has a Julia package in PalmerPenguins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip With Caption\n\n\n\nHowever, due to a painful little episode part way through writing all these posts I mistakenly decided that the PalmerPenguins package was causing me problems in the context of this quarto blog post (it wasn’t… the actual problem was that I had my Julia environment configured incorrectly), so instead I ended up writing a copy of the data to a CSV file and used that instead. Sigh.\nasasa\n\n\nasasa\nOkay, let’s start by loading the packages I’ll need for this post:\nusing CSV\nusing DataFrames\nusing Plots\nusing StatsPlots\nAmazing. Thrilling. Et cetera.

    "text": "Scatter plots\nAs you might imagine, there’s more than one way you can go about constructing a data visualisation in Julia. For example, there’s the AlgebraOfGraphics system that appears share some design philosophy with the ggplot2 package in R. There’s also Compose, which aims to be a modernised version of the grid package in R, and the Gadfly data visualisation system built on top of it. Any of these might have been better choices for me to explore in the first instance, but for whatever reason1 I chose instead to look at the Plots package and its extension package StatsPlots.\n1 Honestly, at this point I don’t even know why I’m making the choices I’m making in this increasingly-unhinged series of posts. I chose instead to look at the Plots package and its extension package StatsPlots.The impression I get from playing around with Plots/StatsPlots is that its design has more in common with the base graphics system in R than with ggplot2. There’s a generic function plot() that you can use to construct plots, and lots of more specific functions that are essentially wrappers to plot(). For example, I’m going to start by drawing a scatter plot. I could use the wrapper function scatter() for this purposes, but you don’t actually need to do this because it’s effectively the same thing as calling plot() with different defaults. For learning purposes I find it helpful to understand what the different arguments to plot() actually do, so I’ll avoid using the convenience functions here.\nOkay, so here’s a simple scatter plot that plots the bill length of each penguin against the bill depth:\nplot(\n  penguins.bill_length_mm,\n  penguins.bill_depth_mm,\n  seriestype=:scatter,\n  size=(500,500)\n)\nIn this code chunk, the first argument specifies the variable to be plotted on the x-axis and the second specifies the variable to be plotted on the y-axis. No surprises there. The key thing to note is that in the later arguments I’ve specified two plot attributes. The seriestype attribute is what gives me a scatter plot (each observation is plotted with a single discrete plot marker), whereas the size attribute is used to control the size of the image produced in the output (in pixels).\nCool. Well, I can definitely draw something. That feels like a win."

    "text": "Using the @df macro\nOne thing that immediately irritates me about the code I wrote in the last section is that I’ve was passing the raw vectors penguins.bill_length_mm and penguins.bill_depth_mm to the plotting function. When you’re working with a data frame that always feels clunky to me. What you really want to do is just use the column names :bill_length_mm and :bill_depth_mm. On the surface though that seems a little tricky to do, because the plots() function doesn’t necessarily need to be given data that are contained within a data frame.\nThis is where the @df macro comes in handy. Somehow, I have made it three posts into Julia and I have not yet actually had to use a macro for anything, but now is the time. I’ll talk about macros in a just a moment, but for now let’s simply note that I can prefix my call to plot() with a magic bit of syntactic sugar, and now all of a sudden I can simply pass column names and everything works:\n@df penguins plot(\n  :bill_length_mm,\n  :bill_depth_mm,\n  seriestype=:scatter,\n  group=:species,\n  size=(500,500)\n)\nI’ve made a nice little change in this version of the plot too. By mapping the group attribute onto the :species column in the penguins data set, I’ve ended up with a plot that shows each of the three penguin species in a different colour and gives me a nice little explanatory legend.\nI can take this line of thinking a little further and modify other relevant attributes:\n@df penguins plot(\n  :bill_length_mm,\n  :bill_depth_mm,\n  seriestype=:scatter,\n  group=:species,\n  title=\"Palmer Penguins\",\n  xlabel=\"Bill Length (mm)\",\n  ylabel=\"Bill Depth (mm)\",\n  size=(500,500)\n)\nNow I have a plot that has a mildly informative title, and axis labels that are nicer to read. Definitely making some progress now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham. Well, it’s more optimistic than Handmaids Tale I guess"

    "text": "Macros\nSiiiiiiigh. Okay, I used a macro. I suppose I’d better take a quick look at how those things work, right? Macros are part of the Metaprogramming toolkit in Julia, and can be used to manipulate Julia expressions passed by the user, making it possible for code that wouldn’t otherwise be valid Julia to be executed. In essence we’re talking about something qualitatively similar to “non-standard evaluation” in R.\nBased on that description, you can kind of see what the @df macro is doing in the example plots from the last section. It’s taking a call to plots() that specifies only the column names that are associated with a particular vector of observations, and replaces them with the actual data values stored in the relevant data frame when the code is evaluated.\nYou can see this in action here:\n@df penguins println(:bill_length_mm[1:3])\nIn this code, what @df is doing is transforming :bill_length_mm[1:3] (which really shouldn’t work at all) into penguins.bill_length_mm[1:3]. So as a consequence, the code that actually gets executed here is something like println(penguins.bill_length_mm[1:3]), and you get sensible output.\nWell, sort of. I haven’t quite looked into this in a lot of detail yet, and I’m not quite at the point where I’m really prepared to start writing macros of my own, but it does look like @df is slightly more sophisticated, which you can see by using the @macroexpand macro to see what actually gets executed in my little example above:\n@macroexpand @df penguins println(:bill_length_mm[1:3])\nOkay yeah, there’s a little bit more going on than meets the eye (presumably in part because @df is designed to work in the context of the Plots package), but the basic idea makes sense at least. I’m happy to move on and defer a proper dive into macros for a future occasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Earthsea Quartet by Ursula Le Guin. Much better!"

I could alternatively set seriestype=:violin to get a violin plot.\nHere’s an example, just to prove to myself that I understand plot() well enough to create various different kinds of data visualisations. In the code below I’ll first define a bill_lengths data frame that contains only the columns I need and – importantly – removes the missing values (because the violin series can’t handle missing data). Then I’ll use plots() to create a violin plot:\nbill_lengths = penguins |&gt;\n  d -&gt; subset(d, :bill_length_mm =&gt; b -&gt; .!ismissing.(b)) |&gt;\n  d -&gt; select(d, [:species, :bill_length_mm])\n\n@df bill_lengths plot(\n  string.(:species),\n  :bill_length_mm,\n  seriestype=:violin,\n  legend=false,\n  xlabel=\"Species\",\n  ylabel=\"Bill Length (mm)\",\n  size=(500,500)\n)\n\n\nThis is an aside regarding the table.\nYes, that’s what I wanted.

It feels surprisingly comfortable to me, capturing a lot of what I really love about R and also reminding me of the bits about Matlab that I didn’t hate. But it’s also designed for performance in a way that both R and Matlab sometimes struggle with (e.g., in R the solution to “how to I make it fast?” is so often “rewrite the slow bit in C++”), so I guess I can see why a lot of people I admire have a lot of positive things to say about Julia.\nSo yeah.

    "section": "",
    "text": "As my own high school journey comes to an end, I’ve decided to put together a few of the lessons I’ve learned over the years. I didn’t have much guidance when I was a freshman coming into high school, so the following reflections are really what I would’ve told myself back then if I could do so now.\n\nPrioritize more than just schoolwork\nThis is a big one, and really the biggest lesson you should be taking away from this. Your grades are significant factors that play into university admissions and scholarship decisions. But they’re also not the only factors at play, and I would argue that they’re not the most important either (not just for applications, but for your career and life too). More important than your academics are the experiences that build you as a person; don’t miss out on them. (And what are those experiences, you ask? Read on, and you’re sure to find out…)\n\n\nExplore interests\nThis is something that’s really important once you’re in university, and it can give you a good leg-up if you start taking it seriously in high school. Join clubs related to your interests, even if you’re on the edge about whether you’re genuinely interested in some of them (you can always drop some of them if you lose interest).\nBe it robotics (FIRST Robotics), business (DECA), medicine (Brain Bee), or any of the countless other clubs probably at your school, there is no shortage of cliques you can join. And in the event you don’t find exactly what you’re looking for (or maybe you’re just really passionate about something niche), you can always start your club (it doesn’t have to be limited to your school, either; with tools like Discord and Slack, building an online community is easier than ever, and how most of the clubs at my school operate under COVID-19 restrictions).\nAs for myself, I attribute a lot of my current skills to my time spent on Arctos 6135 (a FIRST Robotics team), not just because of how much I learned while working on the team but also because of the mindset I adopted from my time there and how that’s guided my learning up to where I am today. Don’t be one of those people who miss out on clubs because of how much time they spend studying; in my eyes, they’re the fundamental building blocks of your high school experience.\nIf there is ever an optimal time to test the waters and try out experimental things, high school is it. You’ve got the mental plasticity, maturity, and the time surplus to actually make headway towards accomplishing it. All you really need is motivation to get started (and discipline to get finished).\n\n\nBuild (good) habits\nYour habits now are going to dictate how you live your life going forward; make sure that the habits you’ve got are worth having. Don’t get enough exercise (don’t fool yourself, you know whether or not you need more exercise)? Go to the gym, even just for one day (or join an intramural sport; they’re heaps of fun). Don’t get enough sleep? Establish a strict sleeping schedule and follow it. Don’t see your grades rise despite spending hours studying? Figure out where you’re going wrong (be it in your learning or your remembering of information), and build a better study schedule. The hardest part is almost always getting started, so if you can push yourself to get past even just the first hurdle, you’re already making serious progress towards getting to the end.\n\n\nHave fun\nLast but definitely not the least, go out and have fun. High school is a unique experience that you really only go through once, so make the most of your time there. Come university and who knows what after it, high school is just the beginning of the many radical changes you’re going to experience. So while you make sure to keep your grades up and take part in the many opportunities at your disposal, don’t forget to have some fun. Cultivate relationships, and be sure to nip toxic ones in the bud. Looking back on my own experiences in high school, my interactions with my friends and the joyous memories I have of us together are at the top of the list of things I cherish most about my high school experience. Make them some of yours, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hossain2021,\n  author = {Hossain, Sadman},\n  title = {Advice for High School Freshmen},\n  date = {2021-04-13},\n  url = {https://sadmanca.github.io/blog/posts/2021-04-13-advice-for-high-school-freshmen},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHossain, Sadman. 2021. “Advice for High School Freshmen.”\nApril 13, 2021. https://sadmanca.github.io/blog/posts/2021-04-13-advice-for-high-school-freshmen."

    "text": "The memorization strategy you’re probably most familiar with is rote memorization, where you try to memorize something by just repeating it to yourself over and over. And while this might work if you have a short test the day after, it’s one of the worst ways you can memorize something. It’s horrendously inefficient. It won’t help you deeply understand a subject. And it’s not going to help you remember things in the long term. But we can do better.\nThere are loads of little techniques you can use to help you remember things, but what’s most important is going to be your overall strategy when it comes to approaching memorization, and a really good strategy is probably going to be incorporating these in some way.\nLet’s start with encoding. Encoding is all about organizing information, and it’s the first step you take when you’re committing something to memory. How you encode information determines how easily you can store it in your memory and retrieve it later on. If you have poor encoding, you’re going to have poor retrieval. Good encoding can build connections between ideas, so that when you think of one concept, you’re reminded of all the concepts that it’s connected to.\nLet’s look at an example. Imagine if i told you to memorize a set of letters, not caring about their order. You could memorize this without much trouble. But if we reorganize the information it becomes ridiculously easy. That’s encoding for you. What we just did is we took several lower bits of information and encoded them into just a few large bits that are effortless to remember.\nNow, what is the point of all this? The point is you need to structure your notes. When you’re writing something down, don’t copy it word for word. Write it in your own words, connect it to ideas you already know about. Reorganize the information so it’s easiest for you to remember. Use the Cornell note taking method, use mnemonics, mind webs, diagrams, whatever. It doesn’t matter what you do, as long as it works for you.\nThe next strategy is active recall. The idea behind active recall is that testing is better than review. Let me explain.\nSimply reading your textbook or reviewing your notes, is largely a passive process. You come across a concept, recognize that you “know” it, and you move on. You don’t get the textbook on your test. You don’t have your notes. On the test, you have to use the cues in the questions to recall everything from memory. So if you want to do well on tests, all you need to do is practice recalling information from your memory.\nNow, what does this look like? Well, it could be something as simple as reading a chapter in the textbook, closing the textbook, and then writing out everything you can remember from memory. It could be explaining a concept to somebody else. It could be doing practice questions before you review notes. The key is to reduce the amount of recognition you’re doing and increase the amount of recall.\nIf you’re learning something for the first time, this can be really tough. But it will do wonders for your memory. And what’s really great about active recall, is that because it forces you to truly recall information from your memory, you’re able to get a much better understanding of what you actually remember and what you don’t. And that’s going to help you fill the gaps in your knowledge way better than just rereading your notes will.\nAnd finally, we have the glue that keeps everything together and makes sure you don’t forget what you memorize: spaced repetition.\nTo truly understand spaced repetition, you need to first understand something called the forgetting curve. Right after you first learn something, that information is fresh in your memory. But what happens is that, overtime, if you don’t revisit that information, your brain is going to replace it with something else it thinks is more important. The longer you don’t review something, the more you’re going to forget about it. And most of the forgetting is going to happen right after you learned it.\nThis is where spaced repetition comes in. When we review that information, we reset the curve, and retain that knowledge for longer before we begin to forget it again. And so by spacing out your studying so you review right before you’re about to forget, something you might’ve remembered for just a week, becomes something that lasts a month, or longer.\nThis is why choosing to study for a test over several days is a lot better than just cramming the night before: later, when you have to use this information again, you have to spend a lot less effort and time relearning because you used spaced repetition. Another great thing about spaced repetition is that, like active recall, it gives you feedback on your memory. If you review consistently over a period of time, you get a good idea of what you know and what you don’t, and so you’re able to organize your studying a lot better than if you just crammed for one day.\nThe minutiae of how everybody learns is different for every person. But when coupled with habits that incorporate these study strategies optimized for long-term understanding, learning can become a whole lot easier of a process.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hossain2020,\n  author = {Hossain, Sadman},\n  title = {A Guide to Learning},\n  date = {2020-12-14},\n  url = {https://sadmanca.github.io/blog/posts/2020-12-14-a-guide-to-learning},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHossain, Sadman. 2020. “A Guide to Learning.” December 14,\n2020. https://sadmanca.github.io/blog/posts/2020-12-14-a-guide-to-learning."

For many, reaching inbox zero is tantamount to spending more hours than there are in a day (that is, if you deal with every email accordingly instead of simply deleting most of them and ignoring the ordeal entirely).\nThe thing about email is that email itself is not what most people dread. As the default communication channel, it’s one of the easiest ways to contact other individuals or groups in a formal manner. Virtually everyone has an email address; not everyone has a Twitter account, or is willing to default to it for communications.\nWhat sucks about email is not the emails themselves, but rather dealing with what ends up being a bottomless ocean in your inbox. When you can’t change the email that’s coming into your inbox, you need to work on the system you use to deal with the emails that you receive.\nThe key is to reduce the amount of time you spend fighting with your inbox to keep it empty (or as empty as possible), and to avoid the stress that comes with the number beside your inbox button showing you how many unread emails you still have to get through."

The key with sorting your emails is to never leave anything in your inbox at read.\nWhenever I read an email and I don’t delete it immediately, I add a label that distinguishes between emails that need immediate attention, emails that can be dealt with a later date, or emails that just need to be archived under a specific label for future reference. This way, I have specific lists of emails of different priorities that need to be dealt with, allowing me to prioritize my work and preventing my inbox from being cluttered up with a variety of different emails.\nYou can also create different rules and filters to automatically sort your inbox and make your job even easier.

At its core, multitasking is simply switching focus between tasks really quickly. It’s inefficient, and the last thing you want when dealing with email is to be inefficient.\nInstead of checking your email whenever you feel like it, it’s worth it to schedule one or two blocks in your day to deal with your inbox. Having the time blocked out in your day can help avoid the temptation of checking your emails eerie now and then. For example, I schedule all my email tasks after an hour of focused work in the morning, after my lunch in the afternoon, and before dinner in the evening. Sticking to this schedule religiously has allowed me to stay on top of my inbox while wasting as little time as possible.\nThe best thing about building a system for email is that you only need to build it once. With email being such a core part of our work, being able to process email more efficiently saves you a lot of time and stress over time."

So busy, in fact, that every hour of your day is spent doing something, be it work, watching Netflix, enjoying time with friends or family, or anything in between. It’s not as easy to be productive. To not only place your entire focus on the task at hand, but also to be working on something truly valuable to you.\nIt’s harder to be productive. Harder to make your hours count instead of simply counting your hours. Reflecting in a journal can help you deal with that. It can allow you to take a look into what your current future looks like, and compare it with your ideal one. It can allow you to think past tomorrow, and think instead of 2 months from now, even 2 years from now.\nIt can help you put superficial tasks at the bottom of your to do list while bringing your more important (and perhaps less urgent) tasks towards the top. With life being the biggest project we’re ever going to get, it’s worth planning out how you can best live it."

And while it’s important to build our environment to prevent such days from happening, it’s just as important to know how to get out of such slumps as well.\nChoosing a journal forces you to confront yourself about what you’ve been spending your time on. It’s easy to let an unproductive hour turn into a day. Journaling interrupts that process, allowing you to accept lulls in productivity and get back into the swing of things."

    "text": "To Keep A Record (Of Yourself)\nKeeping a journal can help you record all the thoughts you have on a particular day. They may be irrelevant, but they also may be inspirational and even educational for you when you get older and reflect on them. Keeping a journal is like taking family photos; you don’t realize their true sentimental value until looking back on them, often years later.\nWhen I ask people I know if they keep a journal, the answer is usually no. Of course, they follow up by saying they know they should, and that they’ll get started at some point.\nUnfortunately, for most people ‘at some point’ is usually equivalent to never. So if you’re reading this write now and haven’t started journaling yet, I implore you to take a minute and just write your thoughts down on a piece of paper. It doesn’t need to be about anything in particular, or even coherent for that matter.\nWrite about how your career has been progressing, about where you feel you’re headed next. Write About what you’ve done today, what you’ve done yesterday, and what you expect to do tomorrow. Write about the fears lingering at the back of your mind. About the things that are stressing you out.\nThe beauty of a journal is that the possibilities for self-reflection are infinite. If you’re looking to improve your life, get started with a journal. I’m confident you’ll start to view your life more than just a little bit differently."

Unfortunately, you’re only allowed 1 Power-Up per board with the free version.\n\n\n\nPower-Ups\n\n\nEven with only a single Power-Up, Trello is an absolute banger of a tool to use if you’re looking for something that can help you organize everything, from your Mom’s birthday to your projects at work, in one place. A lot of tools try to do everything at once, and end up doing mediocre at best for whatever they try to do. Trello is an example of the rare tool that pulls it off."

It’s free, open source, and insanely configurable (it can be as lightweight or as complex as you want it to be).\nAs someone who does development across multiple machines, it’s important for me to have a consistent workflow with my tools and themes on each of them. While the default VS Code configuration is usable, it’s not ideal. VS Code without any extensions is effectively just a text editor.
