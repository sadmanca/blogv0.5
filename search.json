It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a bullet journal or some fancy system built in Jira or a sticky note that you have on your desk. Since I was first introduced to it, I‚Äôve been rocking Trello as my default to do list and project (read: life) management software."

Each board contains a series of lists, each with a bunch of cards attached. You can easily drag and drop cards between lists, and even send or copy cards (and lists themselves) between boards.\n\n\n\nTrello Kanban System\n\n\nIf we left it at that, Trello would‚Äôve been a nice, simple tool for building to do lists.

For example, I have a board exclusively for schoolwork, which has some cards integrated from my side projects board so I can keep track of everything on my to-do list and avoid having tasks fall into the cracks of my schedule. I also have boards for various extracurriculars, making keeping track of them a much more smooth process than before I used Trello.\n\n\n\nHow I Use It‚Äù"

    "text": "Power(ing)-Up\nWhile Trello has a couple paid tiers, the free version is going to be enough for most people (it‚Äôs definitely enough for me). The one thing you do lose out on with the free version is Power-Ups, which are effectively extensions that add even more functionality to Trello (some are even made by the developers at Trello!).\nSome examples of Power-Up functionality include showing due dates on a calendar (which can be synced with your calendar software of choice), showing the number of days left before a due date (I use this a lot) integrations with cloud services like Google Drive, and so much more. Unfortunately, you‚Äôre only allowed 1 Power-Up per board with the free version.\n\n\n\nPower-Ups\n\n\nEven with only a single Power-Up, Trello is an absolute banger of a tool to use if you‚Äôre looking for something that can help you organize everything, from your Mom‚Äôs birthday to your projects at work, in one place. A lot of tools try to do everything at once, and end up doing mediocre at best for whatever they try to do. Trello is an example of the rare tool that pulls it off."

Time for a victory dance! üíÉ\")\nI know a lot of people loathe the experience of email. For many, reaching inbox zero is tantamount to spending more hours than there are in a day (that is, if you deal with every email accordingly instead of simply deleting most of them and ignoring the ordeal entirely).\nThe thing about email is that email itself is not what most people dread. As the default communication channel, it‚Äôs one of the easiest ways to contact other individuals or groups in a formal manner. Virtually everyone has an email address; not everyone has a Twitter account, or is willing to default to it for communications.\nWhat sucks about email is not the emails themselves, but rather dealing with what ends up being a bottomless ocean in your inbox. When you can‚Äôt change the email that‚Äôs coming into your inbox, you need to work on the system you use to deal with the emails that you receive.\nThe key is to reduce the amount of time you spend fighting with your inbox to keep it empty (or as empty as possible), and to avoid the stress that comes with the number beside your inbox button showing you how many unread emails you still have to get through."

No matter what your email client of choice (I use Gmail), it probably has several keyboard shortcuts for actions like deleting, archiving, labelling, and more.\nGetting familiar with some of these shortcuts can help you deal with multiple emails quickly (or quickly undo send when you realize you‚Äôve made a typo!). What‚Äôs more, these shortcuts can be usually remapped as well, lending you even more control over the fine details of your inbox."

    "text": "Tip 2: Sort Your Emails\nOne of the most useful features of any email client is the ability to add custom labels, enabling you to organize your emails in any way you see fit. The key with sorting your emails is to never leave anything in your inbox at read.\nWhenever I read an email and I don‚Äôt delete it immediately, I add a label that distinguishes between emails that need immediate attention, emails that can be dealt with a later date, or emails that just need to be archived under a specific label for future reference. This way, I have specific lists of emails of different priorities that need to be dealt with, allowing me to prioritize my work and preventing my inbox from being cluttered up with a variety of different emails.\nYou can also create different rules and filters to automatically sort your inbox and make your job even easier. For example, you can set all emails from your colleagues to fall under the ‚ÄòWork‚Äô label, or emails from newsletters to fall under the ‚ÄòNewsletters‚Äô label."

    "text": "Tip 3: Batch Time Spent on Email\nIt can be very tempting to check your inbox every 15 minutes or so, especially if you‚Äôre working on something that might not be very exciting and there‚Äôs a lull in the action, but it‚Äôs crucial to batch sending and dealing with email so you don‚Äôt break your focus by diverting your attention between multiple tasks at a time. At its core, multitasking is simply switching focus between tasks really quickly. It‚Äôs inefficient, and the last thing you want when dealing with email is to be inefficient.\nInstead of checking your email whenever you feel like it, it‚Äôs worth it to schedule one or two blocks in your day to deal with your inbox. Having the time blocked out in your day can help avoid the temptation of checking your emails eerie now and then. For example, I schedule all my email tasks after an hour of focused work in the morning, after my lunch in the afternoon, and before dinner in the evening. Sticking to this schedule religiously has allowed me to stay on top of my inbox while wasting as little time as possible.\nThe best thing about building a system for email is that you only need to build it once. With email being such a core part of our work, being able to process email more efficiently saves you a lot of time and stress over time."

Harder to make your hours count instead of simply counting your hours. Reflecting in a journal can help you deal with that. It can allow you to take a look into what your current future looks like, and compare it with your ideal one. It can allow you to think past tomorrow, and think instead of 2 months from now, even 2 years from now.\nIt can help you put superficial tasks at the bottom of your to do list while bringing your more important (and perhaps less urgent) tasks towards the top.

So if you‚Äôre reading this write now and haven‚Äôt started journaling yet, I implore you to take a minute and just write your thoughts down on a piece of paper.

Write About what you‚Äôve done today, what you‚Äôve done yesterday, and what you expect to do tomorrow. Write about the fears lingering at the back of your mind. About the things that are stressing you out.\nThe beauty of a journal is that the possibilities for self-reflection are infinite. If you‚Äôre looking to improve your life, get started with a journal.

    "section": "",
    "text": "As my own high school journey comes to an end, I‚Äôve decided to put together a few of the lessons I‚Äôve learned over the years. I didn‚Äôt have much guidance when I was a freshman coming into high school, so the following reflections are really what I would‚Äôve told myself back then if I could do so now.\n\nPrioritize more than just schoolwork\nThis is a big one, and really the biggest lesson you should be taking away from this. Your grades are significant factors that play into university admissions and scholarship decisions. But they‚Äôre also not the only factors at play, and I would argue that they‚Äôre not the most important either (not just for applications, but for your career and life too). More important than your academics are the experiences that build you as a person; don‚Äôt miss out on them. (And what are those experiences, you ask? Read on, and you‚Äôre sure to find out‚Ä¶)\n\n\nExplore interests\nThis is something that‚Äôs really important once you‚Äôre in university, and it can give you a good leg-up if you start taking it seriously in high school. Join clubs related to your interests, even if you‚Äôre on the edge about whether you‚Äôre genuinely interested in some of them (you can always drop some of them if you lose interest).\nBe it robotics (FIRST Robotics), business (DECA), medicine (Brain Bee), or any of the countless other clubs probably at your school, there is no shortage of cliques you can join. And in the event you don‚Äôt find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for (or maybe you‚Äôre just really passionate about something niche), you can always start your club (it doesn‚Äôt have to be limited to your school, either; with tools like Discord and Slack, building an online community is easier than ever, and how most of the clubs at my school operate under COVID-19 restrictions).\nAs for myself, I attribute a lot of my current skills to my time spent on Arctos 6135 (a FIRST Robotics team), not just because of how much I learned while working on the team but also because of the mindset I adopted from my time there and how that‚Äôs guided my learning up to where I am today. Don‚Äôt be one of those people who miss out on clubs because of how much time they spend studying; in my eyes, they‚Äôre the fundamental building blocks of your high school experience.\nIf there is ever an optimal time to test the waters and try out experimental things, high school is it. You‚Äôve got the mental plasticity, maturity, and the time surplus to actually make headway towards accomplishing it. All you really need is motivation to get started (and discipline to get finished).\n\n\nBuild (good) habits\nYour habits now are going to dictate how you live your life going forward; make sure that the habits you‚Äôve got are worth having. Don‚Äôt get enough exercise (don‚Äôt fool yourself, you know whether or not you need more exercise)? Go to the gym, even just for one day (or join an intramural sport; they‚Äôre heaps of fun). Don‚Äôt get enough sleep? Establish a strict sleeping schedule and follow it. Don‚Äôt see your grades rise despite spending hours studying? Figure out where you‚Äôre going wrong (be it in your learning or your remembering of information), and build a better study schedule. The hardest part is almost always getting started, so if you can push yourself to get past even just the first hurdle, you‚Äôre already making serious progress towards getting to the end.\n\n\nHave fun\nLast but definitely not the least, go out and have fun. High school is a unique experience that you really only go through once, so make the most of your time there. Come university and who knows what after it, high school is just the beginning of the many radical changes you‚Äôre going to experience. So while you make sure to keep your grades up and take part in the many opportunities at your disposal, don‚Äôt forget to have some fun.

You‚Äôre finally in that type of course that allows you to put whatever you want on your cheat sheet for the exam, no requirement to have handwritten it on your tablet or (god forbid) using a physical pen on a physical piece of paper, just free reign to type all of it up and copy-paste images to your heart‚Äôs content. As an engineering student, such a scenario appears rarely, but when it does, it is oh-so-sweet.\nExcept‚Ä¶ when the opportunity does arise, it‚Äôs usually for a course where the lecture content rivals some textbooks in just the sheer amount of concepts covered (typically 1k+ slides over the course of a semester, with each slide as dense and filled to the brim with testable content as any other). Which leads to the question: what‚Äôs the best way of writing out everything you can reasonably put down on a single sheet of paper (double-sided, of course)?\nThe answer is surprisingly simple.

    "text": "The Medium\nPicking the tool of choice for writing your cheat sheet.\nThis really just boils down to picking one of two choices: taking a WYSIWYG editor approach (word processors the likes of Microsoft Word and Google Docs) or a programmatic approach using a typesetting engine (normally one would just use LaTeX, but the newcomer Typst engine shows a lot of promise and as we‚Äôll see later on, is a hidden gem for making all the granular changes needed for a cheat sheet).\nThere are some third-party alternatives like https://cheatsheets-editor.com/ and a handful of side projects posted on Github, but they lack the fine-grained customizability that is sorely needed for making your cheat sheet pixel-perfect (including setting fractional font sizes, word and line spacing, character kerning, and most notably image placement).\nThe cream of the crop is Typst, and here‚Äôs why you should be using it instead of some of the other options at your disposal.\n\nGoogle Docs/Microsoft Word\nI‚Äôve successfully used Google Docs to make a really dense cheat sheet in the before (specifically, for an operating systems course, which, as any computer science or engineering student can tell you, has oodles of terminology and concepts that you need to remember), and while it‚Äôs decent to some degree, it‚Äôs lacking in a lot of ways (almost all of which are remedied by Typst). Here‚Äôs just a few of why you shouldn‚Äôt be using Google Docs for your cheat sheet:\n\nIt gets real slow when word count gets real high, especially in the web-based Google Docs\nZooming in/out to parse through really small text is a hassle, especially when it comes to finding specific words or phrases amongst an ocean of text\nMaking document-wide changes to text formatting (like changing the highlight colour of all bolded text) is at best a finnicky modification of document styles and at worst a completely manual endeavour involving lots of copy-pasting (and trust me, trying to use the format painter with paragraphs of teeny-tiny text without accidentally modifying anything you don‚Äôt want to modify is a lesson in pure frustration)\nIt‚Äôs really hard to plan out how to organize content (tables would be the ideal way of grouping text together, if they weren‚Äôt so finicky to adjust), and moving content from one place to another requires so much reshuffling that it makes you question whether the whole thing is even worth it in the first place (and it is, just not if you‚Äôre doing in Google Docs)\nAdding, updating, and removing images is an exercise in frustration and a reminder of how true to life that one meme is (about Word spazzing out your delicately edited formatting for the entire document when you slightly move an image by 1 mm)\n\nSo the WYSIWYG editor approach just isn‚Äôt going to cut it for making all the small changes you‚Äôre going to need to make for your awe-inspiring cheat sheet. Which leads us to the programmatic approach, and the obvious choice, LaTeX.\n\n\nLaTeX\nLook, I love LaTeX as much as the next guy, but there‚Äôs a couple of key pain points with LaTeX that make it suboptimal compared to Typst. Specifically‚Ä¶\n\nIt‚Äôs slow to render when there‚Äôs a whole lotta text (and frustratingly, will need to render the entire document even if all you do is change a single word)\nAnything and everything requires a metric ton of boilerplate syntax (typing out backslashes and curly brackets is the last thing I want to do 1k words in)\nIt‚Äôs practically impossible for the layperson to reasonably extend LaTeX code beyond something simple like shorthand functions for formatting text (which is most people just use templates built by people who‚Äôve spent a lot of time on them)\n\nOn that last point, I took a quick search on Github for any LaTeX cheat sheet templates that might be a suitable starting point for something more complex. And‚Ä¶ yeah, while it might pass for a cheat sheet for Vim commands, it‚Äôs wholly inadequate for dealing with the sheer amount of content in your average university course, and is really a microcosm of the whole boilerplate and limited (practical) extensibility issues surrounding the use of LaTeX for making a cheat sheet. I mean, just look at that code üòî.\n\n\n\n\nlatexsheet.tex\n\n\\subsection{Common \\texttt{documentclass} options}\n\\newlength{\\MyLen}\n\\settowidth{\\MyLen}{\\texttt{letterpaper}/\\texttt{a4paper} \\ }\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}p{\\the\\MyLen}%\n                @{}p{\\linewidth-\\the\\MyLen}@{}}\n\\texttt{10pt}/\\texttt{11pt}/\\texttt{12pt} & Font size. \\\\\n\\texttt{letterpaper}/\\texttt{a4paper} & Paper size. \\\\\n\\texttt{twocolumn} & Use two columns. \\\\\n\\texttt{twoside}   & Set margins for two-sided. \\\\\n\\texttt{landscape} & Landscape orientation.

It‚Äôs so damn good that it absolutely deserves it‚Äôs own post, but for now we‚Äôll leave that for another day. What‚Äôs important to note is that it‚Äôs so much easier to write virtually anything in Typst than in LaTeX, and it solves almost all of the pain points in the other tools mentioned above, including:\n\nIncremental compilation, which means that editing content updates in documents/previews instantly (rather than having wait between 1 and many seconds for LaTeX to compile, or for Google Docs/Microsoft Word to stop lagging)\nEasy extensibility: Typst has batteries-included functions for creating tables, drawing lines, setting colours for text and highlighted text (even gradient support is built-in), and so much more. Even the documentation for Typst is amazing, with examples to showcase how to use each of the different functions and how different arguments can affect the output (meanwhile, you pretty much have to learn how to use the intricate features of Google Docs/Microsoft Word by playing around with buttons, and I‚Äôm not even sure where you can get the core LaTeX documentation; https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/ is so complicated that it‚Äôs rather unhelpful, and the Overleaf docs at https://www.overleaf.com/learn are nice for beginners but woefully lack the complexity needed for more advanced documents)\n\nSimilar to LaTeX, Typst supports importing third-party extensions and files built by other people (they‚Äôre even importable into your current document in the same way, using a single line with an #import ... statement rather than \\usepackage{...}).\n\n\nAnother key characteristic of Typst is that you don‚Äôt need any complicated template with tens of lines of boilerplate code to start off writing your cheat sheet so that you have some modicum of structure to follow; you can just start of with something simple (e.g.¬†a single table with a single row and column that fills the entire page) and then build on top of it (e.g.¬†adding more rows and columns that are dynamically sized, with optional adjustments such that some rows/columns can be larger/smaller than others, such that the single table remains filling the entire page with no additional modifications required).\nAnd what‚Äôs brilliant about all of this, is that the Typst team have been generous enough to build a fully functional web application (https://typst.app/) to only store your Typst project files, but also edit them with dynamically updating previews and all sorts of bits and bobs to make your Typst writing experience oh-so-sweet (probably my favourite feature is the ability to not only click on some text or box in the output PDF preview and be immediately directed to the line of Typst markup that‚Äôs generating that specific output but also, with a line of code selected, jump and zoom in directly to the specific page and portion of the generated PDF that the markup is creating; remember this for later, because it comes in incredibly handy when you‚Äôre writing text at a size that‚Äôs on par with some smaller species of ants). https://typst.app/ is to Typst as https://www.overleaf.com/ is to LaTeX (except the Typst web app is so much better than Overleaf that the folks over at Overleaf actually copied their ‚Äúnew‚Äù landing page design to mimic Typst‚Äôs, which I‚Äôm not too surprised about given just how much better Typst is to use).\nIt‚Äôs awe-inspiring to think of just how powerful Typst is given how easy it is to use as well, making it a fantastic option not just for writing cheat sheets but for replacing LaTeX for a ridiculous number of purposes (as for myself, I now exclusively use Typst to typeset pretty much any PDF requiring math notation, which at the time of writing is pretty much just relegated to homework assignments for calculus/algorithms/data structures/database design courses). But we‚Äôre here to figure out how to write a kickass cheat sheet, so let‚Äôs get to it.\n\n\nA reminder\nNow, something that I‚Äôd like to point out before we dive into the meat of how exactly we can use Typst to make our denser-than-osmium cheat sheet is that this isn‚Äôt the only good way of writing a cheat sheet. By all means, you should use whatever you‚Äôre comfortable with to type it out, especially if your goal is to write something that‚Äôs good enough instead of something that‚Äôs incredibly dense (and may also might require a wee bit more squinting than some would prefer). What I‚Äôm investigating here is a way pushing the maximum readable word count in a typed-up cheat sheet to the very limit, which is why breaking down what makes one methodology or tool suboptimal for that purpose compared to another is so important."

    "text": "The Message\nFiguring out how to organize content on your cheat sheet.\nSo, here we are. We‚Äôve got Typst down as our writing utencil of choice, and for the purposes of this scenario, let‚Äôs suppose we‚Äôre writing a cheat sheet for a computer security course (which is just as well, because I‚Äôve got a raw text file just full to the brim of all the different concepts and terminology we‚Äôre going to want to put on our cheat sheet).\nWe‚Äôve got our tool; now we have to figure out how to use it. And in order to do that, there‚Äôs a couple of important things we need to keep in mind.\n\nHow to Make Tiny Text Readable\n\n1. Uniformity means readability\nAs someone who‚Äôs been writing cheat sheets over half a decade now, I‚Äôve made this mistake far too many times in the name of trying to minimize how much white space I leave on my cheat sheets, and almost every time it makes them a complete mess and terribly difficult to parse (which as you can imagine is not ideal in an exam setting where you need to find very specific bits of information in a time constrained environment).\nJust look at this for an example, my cheat sheet for an introductory circuits/electromagnetics course from my very first year of university. I can hardly distinguish the different groups of concepts amongst all the differently sized blocks of diagrams mixed in with text, and I was the one who wrote the entire darn thing, I can only imagine how you, dear reader, must feel looking at this spagetthi gobble of a cheat sheet.\nHow do we maintain uniformity? Well, for starters, stick with a consistent method of structuring your content. The best way of doing this, regardless of whether you‚Äôre using some typesetting engine or a text editor, is with a table. Ideally, a single table that fills up the entire page (so you don‚Äôt have to deal with all the spacing headaches trying to properly sandwich together multiple tables of different sizes onto the same 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper) with consistently sized rows and columns. In addition, go with justified or centre-aligned text instead of left/right-aligned (having straight edges for text boxes is a lot easier to read than text boxes with jagged edges that have no easily parseable pattern)\nOne thing to note: it‚Äôs ok to break uniformity and have something really stick out on your cheat sheet (if it‚Äôs really that important, or maybe if you ran out of time and just need to put something onto paper), just know that when nearly everything breaks uniformity, there isn‚Äôt really any uniformity to be had there (we just call that a mess).\nAnd if you‚Äôre going to be using tables, there‚Äôs another important principle that I like to prescribe:\n\n\n2. It‚Äôs easier to read up-down than left-right\n\nmeans you should have small widths for columns, such that all you need to do is move your eyes straight down from a single horizontal position such that vertical-only movements enable you to parse through an entire column easily (trust me, this saves a lot of eye strain compared to having to read left to right and then down and back to start on the left every few lines)\n\n\n\nGroup related content together\n\nHighlight terms while leaving their definitions as plain text so that you can look into a sea of text and quickly see whether the term you‚Äôre looking for is even present at all first\nBreak up multi-layered content by using multiple levels of formatting for your headings, subheadings, definitions, sub-definitions, and so on.\n\nAlso have separate fonts for important terms, plaintext, and special text (e.g.¬†code, math); ensure that all work well at small scales (adjustments to character and word spacing can luckily be made by Typst, which means all you need to do is focus on readability; you can fit more characters of a thin font in the same space of whitespace compared to a wider font, so keep that in mind and maybe don‚Äôt select something like Stint Ultra Expanded)\n\nHave some method of clearly separating unrelated content (that minimizes use of whitespace, like a dotted line)\n\n\n\n\nOther things to keep in mind\nConvert JPGs to SVGs (which are better than PNGs since you can easily edit them to remove backgrounds or non-essential elements from slides so that you‚Äôre left with the most important details that remain readable at small sizes).\n\n\nImplementing it in Typst\nTo see the whole project in action, take a look at https://typst.app/project/rbJ15a29M2OcglqKcAuWkM. But for an overview of how each individual part of the Typst project works together, continue on reading below. (Note that there are some minute differences between the code linked above and the overview below for clarity purposes.)\nPROJECT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:\n\nüìÅcheatsheet/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅfonts/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅimages/\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aidsheet.typ\n‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content.typ\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lazy.typ\nFirst order of business before we get to the task of structuring our content: the page layout.\nProgrammability is one of Typst‚Äôs strong suits, and so it‚Äôs good practice to set variables for your cheat sheet‚Äôs document formatting properties (e.g.¬†line spacing, image width, font size) because it can enable making minor document-wide changes down the road a whole lot easier. Of course, you‚Äôll notice that I don‚Äôt do this all the time in my code below (and that‚Äôs largely because I wrote this cheat sheet under the time crunch of studying for 2 exams in 2 days, which meant that many a corner had to be cut to get it done).\n\n\naidsheet.typ\n\n#import \"content.typ\": *\n#import \"lazy.typ\": *\n\n#set page(\n  paper: \"us-letter\",\n  margin: (\n    top: 0.2in, \n    bottom: 0.1in, \n    left: 0.2in, \n    right: 0.2in\n  )\n)\n\n// ...\n\n\n\ncontent.typ\n\n#let img-width = 70%\n#let font-size = 3.6pt\n#let line-spacing = 0.2pt\n\n// ...\n\nAdd another couple hundred lines of formatting code (using alias for headers, bolded text, math, highlights, and more), along with a couple thousand lines of actual cheat sheet content, and you find yourself staring at what can only be described as a marvel of modern (text) engineering."

Yt‚Äôs pretty much ideal to go for super high contrast black-white text styles instead of greys bc a lot of BW printers actually just reduce the number of dots printed using the small ultra black ink to make gray show up on paper (which as you can imagine is not ideal for maximizing the resolution of text and images at a small scale; this has burned me in the past a couple of times, and I have learnt to stay away from it ever since)\nI‚Äôve also found that a DPI of 1200 is the sweet spot for getting really high quality prints out; while a smaller DPI could technically remain readable, I‚Äôd recommend going up in font size by a half point or two just to make your cheat sheet a bit easier to read (if you have to use a magnifying glass to read content, then you‚Äôre not exactly making things easier for yourself, which is the entire point behind this whole compressing a textbook into a single sheet of paper)."

    "text": "The memorization strategy you‚Äôre probably most familiar with is rote memorization, where you try to memorize something by just repeating it to yourself over and over. And while this might work if you have a short test the day after, it‚Äôs one of the worst ways you can memorize something. It‚Äôs horrendously inefficient. It won‚Äôt help you deeply understand a subject. And it‚Äôs not going to help you remember things in the long term. But we can do better.\nThere are loads of little techniques you can use to help you remember things, but what‚Äôs most important is going to be your overall strategy when it comes to approaching memorization, and a really good strategy is probably going to be incorporating these in some way.\nLet‚Äôs start with encoding. Encoding is all about organizing information, and it‚Äôs the first step you take when you‚Äôre committing something to memory. How you encode information determines how easily you can store it in your memory and retrieve it later on. If you have poor encoding, you‚Äôre going to have poor retrieval. Good encoding can build connections between ideas, so that when you think of one concept, you‚Äôre reminded of all the concepts that it‚Äôs connected to.\nLet‚Äôs look at an example. Imagine if i told you to memorize a set of letters, not caring about their order. You could memorize this without much trouble. But if we reorganize the information it becomes ridiculously easy. That‚Äôs encoding for you. What we just did is we took several lower bits of information and encoded them into just a few large bits that are effortless to remember.\nNow, what is the point of all this? The point is you need to structure your notes. When you‚Äôre writing something down, don‚Äôt copy it word for word. Write it in your own words, connect it to ideas you already know about. Reorganize the information so it‚Äôs easiest for you to remember. Use the Cornell note taking method, use mnemonics, mind webs, diagrams, whatever. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you do, as long as it works for you.\nThe next strategy is active recall. The idea behind active recall is that testing is better than review. Let me explain.\nSimply reading your textbook or reviewing your notes, is largely a passive process. You come across a concept, recognize that you ‚Äúknow‚Äù it, and you move on. You don‚Äôt get the textbook on your test. You don‚Äôt have your notes. On the test, you have to use the cues in the questions to recall everything from memory. So if you want to do well on tests, all you need to do is practice recalling information from your memory.\nNow, what does this look like? Well, it could be something as simple as reading a chapter in the textbook, closing the textbook, and then writing out everything you can remember from memory. It could be explaining a concept to somebody else. It could be doing practice questions before you review notes. The key is to reduce the amount of recognition you‚Äôre doing and increase the amount of recall.\nIf you‚Äôre learning something for the first time, this can be really tough. But it will do wonders for your memory. And what‚Äôs really great about active recall, is that because it forces you to truly recall information from your memory, you‚Äôre able to get a much better understanding of what you actually remember and what you don‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs going to help you fill the gaps in your knowledge way better than just rereading your notes will.\nAnd finally, we have the glue that keeps everything together and makes sure you don‚Äôt forget what you memorize: spaced repetition.\nTo truly understand spaced repetition, you need to first understand something called the forgetting curve. Right after you first learn something, that information is fresh in your memory. But what happens is that, overtime, if you don‚Äôt revisit that information, your brain is going to replace it with something else it thinks is more important. The longer you don‚Äôt review something, the more you‚Äôre going to forget about it. And most of the forgetting is going to happen right after you learned it.\nThis is where spaced repetition comes in. When we review that information, we reset the curve, and retain that knowledge for longer before we begin to forget it again. And so by spacing out your studying so you review right before you‚Äôre about to forget, something you might‚Äôve remembered for just a week, becomes something that lasts a month, or longer.\nThis is why choosing to study for a test over several days is a lot better than just cramming the night before: later, when you have to use this information again, you have to spend a lot less effort and time relearning because you used spaced repetition. Another great thing about spaced repetition is that, like active recall, it gives you feedback on your memory. If you review consistently over a period of time, you get a good idea of what you know and what you don‚Äôt, and so you‚Äôre able to organize your studying a lot better than if you just crammed for one day.\nThe minutiae of how everybody learns is different for every person. But when coupled with habits that incorporate these study strategies optimized for long-term understanding, learning can become a whole lot easier of a process.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hossain2020,\n  author = {Hossain, Sadman},\n  title = {A Guide to Learning},\n  date = {2020-12-14},\n  url = {https://sadman.ca/posts/2020-12-14-a-guide-to-learning},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHossain, Sadman. 2020. ‚ÄúA Guide to Learning.‚Äù December 14,\n2020. https://sadman.ca/posts/2020-12-14-a-guide-to-learning."
