The one thing you do lose out on with the free version is Power-Ups, which are effectively extensions that add even more functionality to Trello (some are even made by the developers at Trello!).\nSome examples of Power-Up functionality include showing due dates on a calendar (which can be synced with your calendar software of choice), showing the number of days left before a due date (I use this a lot) integrations with cloud services like Google Drive, and so much more. Unfortunately, you‚Äôre only allowed 1 Power-Up per board with the free version.\n\n\n\nPower-Ups\n\n\nEven with only a single Power-Up, Trello is an absolute banger of a tool to use if you‚Äôre looking for something that can help you organize everything, from your Mom‚Äôs birthday to your projects at work, in one place. A lot of tools try to do everything at once, and end up doing mediocre at best for whatever they try to do. Trello is an example of the rare tool that pulls it off."

    "text": "The memorization strategy you‚Äôre probably most familiar with is rote memorization, where you try to memorize something by just repeating it to yourself over and over. And while this might work if you have a short test the day after, it‚Äôs one of the worst ways you can memorize something. It‚Äôs horrendously inefficient. It won‚Äôt help you deeply understand a subject. And it‚Äôs not going to help you remember things in the long term. But we can do better.\nThere are loads of little techniques you can use to help you remember things, but what‚Äôs most important is going to be your overall strategy when it comes to approaching memorization, and a really good strategy is probably going to be incorporating these in some way.\nLet‚Äôs start with encoding. Encoding is all about organizing information, and it‚Äôs the first step you take when you‚Äôre committing something to memory. How you encode information determines how easily you can store it in your memory and retrieve it later on. If you have poor encoding, you‚Äôre going to have poor retrieval. Good encoding can build connections between ideas, so that when you think of one concept, you‚Äôre reminded of all the concepts that it‚Äôs connected to.\nLet‚Äôs look at an example. Imagine if i told you to memorize a set of letters, not caring about their order. You could memorize this without much trouble. But if we reorganize the information it becomes ridiculously easy. That‚Äôs encoding for you. What we just did is we took several lower bits of information and encoded them into just a few large bits that are effortless to remember.\nNow, what is the point of all this? The point is you need to structure your notes. When you‚Äôre writing something down, don‚Äôt copy it word for word. Write it in your own words, connect it to ideas you already know about. Reorganize the information so it‚Äôs easiest for you to remember. Use the Cornell note taking method, use mnemonics, mind webs, diagrams, whatever. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you do, as long as it works for you.\nThe next strategy is active recall. The idea behind active recall is that testing is better than review. Let me explain.\nSimply reading your textbook or reviewing your notes, is largely a passive process. You come across a concept, recognize that you ‚Äúknow‚Äù it, and you move on. You don‚Äôt get the textbook on your test. You don‚Äôt have your notes. On the test, you have to use the cues in the questions to recall everything from memory. So if you want to do well on tests, all you need to do is practice recalling information from your memory.\nNow, what does this look like? Well, it could be something as simple as reading a chapter in the textbook, closing the textbook, and then writing out everything you can remember from memory. It could be explaining a concept to somebody else. It could be doing practice questions before you review notes. The key is to reduce the amount of recognition you‚Äôre doing and increase the amount of recall.\nIf you‚Äôre learning something for the first time, this can be really tough. But it will do wonders for your memory. And what‚Äôs really great about active recall, is that because it forces you to truly recall information from your memory, you‚Äôre able to get a much better understanding of what you actually remember and what you don‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs going to help you fill the gaps in your knowledge way better than just rereading your notes will.\nAnd finally, we have the glue that keeps everything together and makes sure you don‚Äôt forget what you memorize: spaced repetition.\nTo truly understand spaced repetition, you need to first understand something called the forgetting curve. Right after you first learn something, that information is fresh in your memory. But what happens is that, overtime, if you don‚Äôt revisit that information, your brain is going to replace it with something else it thinks is more important. The longer you don‚Äôt review something, the more you‚Äôre going to forget about it. And most of the forgetting is going to happen right after you learned it.\nThis is where spaced repetition comes in. When we review that information, we reset the curve, and retain that knowledge for longer before we begin to forget it again. And so by spacing out your studying so you review right before you‚Äôre about to forget, something you might‚Äôve remembered for just a week, becomes something that lasts a month, or longer.\nThis is why choosing to study for a test over several days is a lot better than just cramming the night before: later, when you have to use this information again, you have to spend a lot less effort and time relearning because you used spaced repetition. Another great thing about spaced repetition is that, like active recall, it gives you feedback on your memory. If you review consistently over a period of time, you get a good idea of what you know and what you don‚Äôt, and so you‚Äôre able to organize your studying a lot better than if you just crammed for one day.\nThe minutiae of how everybody learns is different for every person. But when coupled with habits that incorporate these study strategies optimized for long-term understanding, learning can become a whole lot easier of a process.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hossain2020,\n  author = {Hossain, Sadman},\n  title = {A Guide to Learning},\n  date = {2020-12-14},\n  url = {https://sadman.ca/posts/2020-12-14-a-guide-to-learning},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHossain, Sadman. 2020. ‚ÄúA Guide to Learning.‚Äù December 14,\n2020. https://sadman.ca/posts/2020-12-14-a-guide-to-learning."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As my own high school journey comes to an end, I‚Äôve decided to put together a few of the lessons I‚Äôve learned over the years. I didn‚Äôt have much guidance when I was a freshman coming into high school, so the following reflections are really what I would‚Äôve told myself back then if I could do so now.\n\nPrioritize more than just schoolwork\nThis is a big one, and really the biggest lesson you should be taking away from this. Your grades are significant factors that play into university admissions and scholarship decisions. But they‚Äôre also not the only factors at play, and I would argue that they‚Äôre not the most important either (not just for applications, but for your career and life too). More important than your academics are the experiences that build you as a person; don‚Äôt miss out on them. (And what are those experiences, you ask? Read on, and you‚Äôre sure to find out‚Ä¶)\n\n\nExplore interests\nThis is something that‚Äôs really important once you‚Äôre in university, and it can give you a good leg-up if you start taking it seriously in high school. Join clubs related to your interests, even if you‚Äôre on the edge about whether you‚Äôre genuinely interested in some of them (you can always drop some of them if you lose interest).\nBe it robotics (FIRST Robotics), business (DECA), medicine (Brain Bee), or any of the countless other clubs probably at your school, there is no shortage of cliques you can join. And in the event you don‚Äôt find exactly what you‚Äôre looking for (or maybe you‚Äôre just really passionate about something niche), you can always start your club (it doesn‚Äôt have to be limited to your school, either; with tools like Discord and Slack, building an online community is easier than ever, and how most of the clubs at my school operate under COVID-19 restrictions).\nAs for myself, I attribute a lot of my current skills to my time spent on Arctos 6135 (a FIRST Robotics team), not just because of how much I learned while working on the team but also because of the mindset I adopted from my time there and how that‚Äôs guided my learning up to where I am today. Don‚Äôt be one of those people who miss out on clubs because of how much time they spend studying; in my eyes, they‚Äôre the fundamental building blocks of your high school experience.\nIf there is ever an optimal time to test the waters and try out experimental things, high school is it. You‚Äôve got the mental plasticity, maturity, and the time surplus to actually make headway towards accomplishing it. All you really need is motivation to get started (and discipline to get finished).\n\n\nBuild (good) habits\nYour habits now are going to dictate how you live your life going forward; make sure that the habits you‚Äôve got are worth having. Don‚Äôt get enough exercise (don‚Äôt fool yourself, you know whether or not you need more exercise)? Go to the gym, even just for one day (or join an intramural sport; they‚Äôre heaps of fun). Don‚Äôt get enough sleep? Establish a strict sleeping schedule and follow it. Don‚Äôt see your grades rise despite spending hours studying? Figure out where you‚Äôre going wrong (be it in your learning or your remembering of information), and build a better study schedule. The hardest part is almost always getting started, so if you can push yourself to get past even just the first hurdle, you‚Äôre already making serious progress towards getting to the end.\n\n\nHave fun\nLast but definitely not the least, go out and have fun. High school is a unique experience that you really only go through once, so make the most of your time there. Come university and who knows what after it, high school is just the beginning of the many radical changes you‚Äôre going to experience. So while you make sure to keep your grades up and take part in the many opportunities at your disposal, don‚Äôt forget to have some fun. Cultivate relationships, and be sure to nip toxic ones in the bud. Looking back on my own experiences in high school, my interactions with my friends and the joyous memories I have of us together are at the top of the list of things I cherish most about my high school experience. Make them some of yours, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hossain2021,\n  author = {Hossain, Sadman},\n  title = {Advice for High School Freshmen},\n  date = {2021-04-13},\n  url = {https://sadman.ca/posts/2021-04-13-advice-for-high-school-freshmen},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHossain, Sadman. 2021. ‚ÄúAdvice for High School Freshmen.‚Äù\nApril 13, 2021. https://sadman.ca/posts/2021-04-13-advice-for-high-school-freshmen."

It‚Äôs not as easy to be productive. To not only place your entire focus on the task at hand, but also to be working on something truly valuable to you.\nIt‚Äôs harder to be productive. Harder to make your hours count instead of simply counting your hours. Reflecting in a journal can help you deal with that. It can allow you to take a look into what your current future looks like, and compare it with your ideal one. It can allow you to think past tomorrow, and think instead of 2 months from now, even 2 years from now.\nIt can help you put superficial tasks at the bottom of your to do list while bringing your more important (and perhaps less urgent) tasks towards the top. With life being the biggest project we‚Äôre ever going to get, it‚Äôs worth planning out how you can best live it."

And while it‚Äôs important to build our environment to prevent such days from happening, it‚Äôs just as important to know how to get out of such slumps as well.\nChoosing a journal forces you to confront yourself about what you‚Äôve been spending your time on. It‚Äôs easy to let an unproductive hour turn into a day. Journaling interrupts that process, allowing you to accept lulls in productivity and get back into the swing of things."

    "text": "To Keep A Record (Of Yourself)\nKeeping a journal can help you record all the thoughts you have on a particular day. They may be irrelevant, but they also may be inspirational and even educational for you when you get older and reflect on them. Keeping a journal is like taking family photos; you don‚Äôt realize their true sentimental value until looking back on them, often years later.\nWhen I ask people I know if they keep a journal, the answer is usually no. Of course, they follow up by saying they know they should, and that they‚Äôll get started at some point.\nUnfortunately, for most people ‚Äòat some point‚Äô is usually equivalent to never. So if you‚Äôre reading this write now and haven‚Äôt started journaling yet, I implore you to take a minute and just write your thoughts down on a piece of paper. It doesn‚Äôt need to be about anything in particular, or even coherent for that matter.\nWrite about how your career has been progressing, about where you feel you‚Äôre headed next. Write About what you‚Äôve done today, what you‚Äôve done yesterday, and what you expect to do tomorrow. Write about the fears lingering at the back of your mind. About the things that are stressing you out.\nThe beauty of a journal is that the possibilities for self-reflection are infinite. If you‚Äôre looking to improve your life, get started with a journal. I‚Äôm confident you‚Äôll start to view your life more than just a little bit differently."

Time for a victory dance! üíÉ\")\nI know a lot of people loathe the experience of email. For many, reaching inbox zero is tantamount to spending more hours than there are in a day (that is, if you deal with every email accordingly instead of simply deleting most of them and ignoring the ordeal entirely).\nThe thing about email is that email itself is not what most people dread. As the default communication channel, it‚Äôs one of the easiest ways to contact other individuals or groups in a formal manner. Virtually everyone has an email address; not everyone has a Twitter account, or is willing to default to it for communications.\nWhat sucks about email is not the emails themselves, but rather dealing with what ends up being a bottomless ocean in your inbox. When you can‚Äôt change the email that‚Äôs coming into your inbox, you need to work on the system you use to deal with the emails that you receive.\nThe key is to reduce the amount of time you spend fighting with your inbox to keep it empty (or as empty as possible), and to avoid the stress that comes with the number beside your inbox button showing you how many unread emails you still have to get through."

No matter what your email client of choice (I use Gmail), it probably has several keyboard shortcuts for actions like deleting, archiving, labelling, and more.\nGetting familiar with some of these shortcuts can help you deal with multiple emails quickly (or quickly undo send when you realize you‚Äôve made a typo!). What‚Äôs more, these shortcuts can be usually remapped as well, lending you even more control over the fine details of your inbox."

    "text": "Tip 2: Sort Your Emails\nOne of the most useful features of any email client is the ability to add custom labels, enabling you to organize your emails in any way you see fit. The key with sorting your emails is to never leave anything in your inbox at read.\nWhenever I read an email and I don‚Äôt delete it immediately, I add a label that distinguishes between emails that need immediate attention, emails that can be dealt with a later date, or emails that just need to be archived under a specific label for future reference. This way, I have specific lists of emails of different priorities that need to be dealt with, allowing me to prioritize my work and preventing my inbox from being cluttered up with a variety of different emails.\nYou can also create different rules and filters to automatically sort your inbox and make your job even easier. For example, you can set all emails from your colleagues to fall under the ‚ÄòWork‚Äô label, or emails from newsletters to fall under the ‚ÄòNewsletters‚Äô label."

    "text": "Tip 3: Batch Time Spent on Email\nIt can be very tempting to check your inbox every 15 minutes or so, especially if you‚Äôre working on something that might not be very exciting and there‚Äôs a lull in the action, but it‚Äôs crucial to batch sending and dealing with email so you don‚Äôt break your focus by diverting your attention between multiple tasks at a time. At its core, multitasking is simply switching focus between tasks really quickly. It‚Äôs inefficient, and the last thing you want when dealing with email is to be inefficient.\nInstead of checking your email whenever you feel like it, it‚Äôs worth it to schedule one or two blocks in your day to deal with your inbox. Having the time blocked out in your day can help avoid the temptation of checking your emails eerie now and then. For example, I schedule all my email tasks after an hour of focused work in the morning, after my lunch in the afternoon, and before dinner in the evening. Sticking to this schedule religiously has allowed me to stay on top of my inbox while wasting as little time as possible.\nThe best thing about building a system for email is that you only need to build it once. With email being such a core part of our work, being able to process email more efficiently saves you a lot of time and stress over time."
