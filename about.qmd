And so we come to the third post in my extremely ill-considered foray into learning Julia. In the [first part](/posts/2024-03-01_julia-foundation/) of the series I taught myself some of the foundations for writing Julia code, in the [second part](/posts/2024-03-02_julia-data-frames/) I discussed data wrangling in Julia, and so in the third and -- dear god in heaven please -- last of them, I'll take a look at data visualisation using the [Plots](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/) package, and using [PalmerPenguins](https://juliapackages.com/p/palmerpenguins) as my data set.

```{python}
import numpy as np

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
```
