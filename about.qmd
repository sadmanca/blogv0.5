Sadman Hossain is a 3rd year computer engineering student at the Univeristy of Toronto. When not creating more AutoHotkey shortcuts for automating the mouse away, Sadman enjoys binge-reading really long sci-fi/apocalyptic/fantasy novels ([tracked on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/152185079-sadman-hossain)).

    while not coding:
        sleep(900)  # Nap time for code monkeys
        if wake_up_with_idea():
            break
    code.write(bug)
    coffee.refill()
else:
    print("â˜• Error: Too much coffee, not enough code!")
