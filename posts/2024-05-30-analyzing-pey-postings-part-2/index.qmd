- table of contents at top indicating parts in series
- extending relational database by making tables for companies
- manually going thru fields like job locations and modifinyg (e.g. standardize location to city, country; deal with multiple countries listed)
- part 3 is analyzing for trends
- part 4 is comparing with waterloo co-op postings (found a fantastic resource in waterlooworms repo)
- add links to cleaned databases (see datasette) at top of all parts and end of parts 1 & 2
    - consider using react components instead of table links (altho tables work well as is)
- read up on optimizing/cleaning relational databases in SQL 
- create JSON, CSV exports of data and at least 1 interactive viewer (leave visualizations for part 3)
