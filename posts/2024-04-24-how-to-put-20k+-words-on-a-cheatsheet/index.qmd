Picture it. You're finally in that type of course that allows you to put *whatever* you want on your cheatsheet for the exam, no requirement to have handwritten it on your tablet or (god forbid) using a physical pen on a physical piece of paper, just free reign to type all of it up and copy-paste images to your heart's content. As an engineering student, such a scenario appears rarely, but when it does, it is oh-so-sweet.

Except... when the opportunity does arise, it's usually for a course where the lecture content rivals some textbooks in just the sheer amount of concepts covered (imagine over 1k slides over the course of a semester, with each slide as dense and filled to the brim with testable content as any other). Which leads to the question: what's the best way of writing out everything you can reasonably put down on a single sheet of paper (double-sided, of course)?
